# Architecture_n_Tiers
This is the project of my 3rd year in the TSE about store online.
Our Group want to developpe a web site about the store online just for my school.
1. The Student Organization in our school can sell their produits for all students in the web site.
2. All students also can sell or buy their own produits or others produits in this web site.(e.g. appliances, 
   furnitures and residences ...)
This repository is mainly for the front-end and until now I use Bootstrap+AngularJS for developping, perhaps 
I will introduce Node.js in this project.
